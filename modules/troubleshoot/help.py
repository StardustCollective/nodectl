  The {colored('download_status','cyan')} command can be used to 
  monitor the progress of your Node's {colored('DownloadInProgress','yellow')} state.
    
  During a Node's {colored('join','yellow')} process, to become part of the cluster 
  for the profile(s) configured, the Node undergoes a series of essential 
  initialization tasks to ensure it integrates and functions properly
  as a peer on the cluster.

  Once your Node completes the initial phases of authentication and 
  becomes a peer on the cluster, it must synchronize and gain knowledge 
  about the known blockchain before actively participating in consensus 
  and earning rewards.  
  
  Constellation Network employs an {colored('incremental snapshot','yellow')} strategy 
  to minimize the ingress "cost" for downloading blockchain snapshots. When a new 
  Node joins the cluster, it will undergo a {colored('one time','red')} extended period
  of learning about the entire blockchain. For an existing Node rejoining the cluster, 
  it is required to calculate the differences between its previous state and the 
  current blockchain state.
    
  Following authentication, your Node may temporarily remain in the 
  {colored('WaitingForDownload','yellow')} state, which is a relatively inactive phase 
  with no notable progress.  Due to this, when you execute the 
  {colored('download_status','cyan')} command, it will monitor your Node's status, via
  a timer [verses a progress indicator], continually checking until the 
  Node transitions to {colored('DownloadInProgress','yellow')}.
  
  When in {colored('DownloadInProgress','yellow')} state, nodectl will actively oversee your Node's activities, 
  presenting a progress indicator on the screen that provides an estimate 
  of the completion percentage for this process.  
  
  Part 1: {colored('Downloading snapshots','cyan')}: Above the progress indicator, you'll find 
          the snapshots being downloaded to your Node, displayed by their 
          corresponding ordinal. This will be represented as a decreasing 
          counter.

  Part 2: {colored('BlockAcceptanceManager','cyan')}: The progress indicator will be
          modified. You will see the "height" of the last snapshot block and 
          the current "height" reached. This will be displayed as an increasing 
          counter.
  
  To the right of the counters, you will see a differential counter to help ease the 
  calculation of what is left to be processed from either part 1 or part 2.

  You can setup {colored('nodectl','blue',attrs=['bold'])} to handle and control auto_restart
  from its configuration file.  By {colored('default','green')} this feature is disabled.  
  Issue {colored('sudo nodectl configure','cyan')} to enable.
  
  {colored('Auto restart','green')} is a special feature of nodectl that will continuously monitor
  your Node to make sure the various profiles are on the cluster
  and that each profiles state on the cluster is in {colored('Ready','green')} state,
  and the {colored('Session','green')} is up-to-date.
  
  Processing each profile in its own thread (i/o) nodectl will wait a
  randomly set time (per thread) and check the Node's condition after
  each successive random sleep timer expires.
  
  In the event that your Node is identified to have either:
    - Its {colored('service','cyan')} in an inactive state
    - Node's cluster {colored('state','cyan')} is {colored('not','red')} 'Ready'
    - The Node's known cluster {colored('session','cyan')} does not match the cluster's
      known {colored('session','cyan')}.
  the Node will begin an automatic restart.
  
  If the {colored('session','cyan')} of the cluster does not match the Node session that was 
  established at the cluster's genesis at the beginning of the cluster's initialization,
  an {colored('auto_restart','cyan')} will be triggered.
  
  This session will change if a {colored('restart','cyan')} or {colored('roll-back','cyan')} is identified. 
   
  If your Node is currently joined to an older {colored('session','cyan')} it will no longer be participating 
  on the proper cluster (what can be considered a 'floating island'),
  {colored('auto_restart','cyan')} will attempt to correct the situation.
  
  {colored('IMPORTANT','red')}
  An {colored('auto_restart','cyan')} may take up to {colored('18 minutes to complete','white',attrs=['bold'])}.  
  This is because the Node will detect one or both profiles down and restart the Global layer0 first
  before it then attempts to bring up any Metagraphs.  To avoid timing conflicts
  with other Node's that may have auto_restart enabled {colored('auto_restart','cyan')} has random
  timers put in place throughout a restart process.  As you will need to properly
  link your layer1 Metagraph to the Global layer0. {colored('Understanding','green')} this is a
  background and unattended process, the {colored('delay','cyan')} is created on purpose.
  
  It is {colored('recommended','cyan')} by the developers to link to layer1 through your
  Node's own Global layer0 connection.
  
  {colored('IMPORTANT','red')}
  {colored('auto_restart','cyan')} is not perfect and should be used as a tool
  to help keep your Node up in a consistent fashion; however, it may not be
  fool proof, and {colored('you should still monitor your Node manually','red',attrs=['bold'])} to make sure it
  stays online with the proper known cluster session.
  
  If you are using {colored('auto_restart','cyan')} please remember if you are physically 
  monitoring your Node while it is enabled, and have patience to allow it 
  to figure out how to get back online by itself as necessary.  Forcing a manual restart
  will disable {colored('auto_restart','cyan')}.  If enabled in the configuration, nodectl
  will attempt to reenable auto_restart after any command that requires it to be 
  temporarily disabled.
  
  {colored('IMPORTANT','red')}
  In order to avoid duplicate or unwanted behavior such as your Node
  restarting when you do not want it started, the {colored('auto_restart','cyan')}
  feature will automatically disable if you attempt to issue any command
  that manipulates the services.
    - leave
    - stop
    - start
    - join
    - restart
    - upgrade
  
  {colored('AUTO UPGRADE','green')}
  You can enable this feature by issuing:
  {colored('sudo nodectl configure -e','cyan')}
  
  {colored('Auto upgrade','cyan')} can only be enabled with auto restart enabled.
  
  During a Tessellation upgrade, the session will change.  This will trigger
  an auto restart.  During the restart, nodectl will identify the version of 
  Tessellation on the Node verses what is running on the cluster. If it does not
  match, nodectl will attempt to upgrade the Tessellation binaries before 
  continuing.
  
  {colored('IMPORTANT','red')}
  {colored('nodectl','blue',attrs=['bold'])} will not auto_upgrade itself.  Newer versions of 
  nodectl may require a {colored('upgrade','green')} be executed in order to update 
  any system services or files that may have changed [for any of 
  many reasons].
  
  {colored('** IMPORTANT **','red',attrs=['bold'])}
  {colored('nodectl','blue',attrs=['bold'])} {colored('auto_restart/auto_upgrade','yellow')} 
  Will {colored('not','red',attrs=['bold'])} work unless the p12 passphrase is present in the configuration
  file.  In order to join the network unattended, {colored('nodectl','blue',attrs=['bold'])} will need to
  know how to authenticate against the Hypergraph.

  Since Python is a interpreted language and nodectl is open source, it
  it is hard to incorpotate a way to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks to
  obviate authenticity concerns; however, we will still try :-)
  
  nodectl is compliled into a binary and the binary is code signed using
  an internal private key.  The code signed hash and the public key are
  available on the github respository and downloaded via an HTTPS connection.  
  
  {colored(extended,'cyan')} will download [every time requested] the:
   - public key
   - hash of the binary
   - signature signed by the private key
   
  The utility will verify the binary by decrypting the binary using the hash 
  utilizing the public key and comparing to the signature of the
  digital hash.  {colored(extended,'cyan')} will also offer you manual instructions 
  on how to verify that the hash and public key match what is available on 
  the repository. 

  Be aware that if you download a version of nodectl from a nefarious source 
  [ unkowningly ] "they" can easily provided a public key and binary hash from that
  same source which will give you a {colored('FALSE POSITIVE','red')} sense of authenticity.
  
  As safe guards, nodectl will provide you with the proper link to view the
  public key and binary hash manually, so that you can see if they match what 
  is on your node directly, this is a manual intervention that will asure you 
  that you have a valid copy of nodectl. As also shown above ^
    
  public_key (of current version only) replace <version> with currently
  version not including periods:  eg) v2.10.0 = v2100

  Note: public key and hash are available as part of the code base under the 
        admin folder for ease of viewing
        signature file is a binary available in the version assets
        
  If you would like to compare public and binary hash for versions lower than
  the current version, you can download them from the release artifacts on the
  Github repository, tagged for that specific version.

                      produces a fixed-size string of characters, making it suitable for 
                      verifying the integrity of data.
  Creation Date:  When was the certificate created.
  Version:        The version number of the certificate.
  Keys Found:     How many keys does this p12 key store file hold.
  Signature Algo: Method or algorithm used to generate a digital signature and 
                  verify its authenticity.
  Public Algo:    Public algorithm that is a type of cryptographic algorithm that 
                  uses two mathematically distinct keys.
    - The public key is shared openly, and it's used for encryption or verification. 
    - The private key is kept secret and is used for decryption or signing.
  Entry Type:     Refers to the different types of cryptographic objects or entities 
                  that can be stored within the file.
    - PrivateKeyEntry: Private key and its associated X.509 certificate chain.
    - Certificate-only Entry: Contains only the X.509 certificate or certificates 
                              without the private key.
    - Secret Key Entry: Include entries for symmetric (secret) keys.
    
  Owner/Issuer: The known owner of the private key that signed this certificate. 
  Owner/Issuer: Common Name: primary identifier associated with the 
                             certificate holder, which could be 
                             an individual, organization, server, or 
                             other entity.

  The command takes a few options.
  
  required:
  {colored('-p <profile_name> | all','green')}  
  
  optional:
  {colored('-w <seconds>','green')} 
  
  The {colored('-w','cyan')} will engage the {colored('watch','cyan')} option. The watch option will continuously watch
  your Node's profile status for the default of 15 seconds. If the watch option is 
  followed by an integer above 5 seconds, the watch feature will refresh the 
  status for the Node Operator entered amount of seconds. If a number of 5 or 
  less is entered, a {colored('RANGE ERROR','red')} message will show on the CLI output and will 
  automatically be defaulted back to 15 seconds.  
    
  Status Command Elements:
    - {colored('profile','cyan')}: Which profile are we reviewing.
    - {colored('service','cyan')}: The name of the profile's service that is used to run the Node.
    - {colored('join state','cyan')}: The present stage of the Node.
    - {colored('API TCP','cyan')}: The TCP/IP ports associated with the:
               - Public API
               - Peer-to-Peer API
               - Internal only CLI API.
    - {colored('ordinals','cyan')}: State of ordinals associated with the Node.
                - The latest ordinal on the Node.
                - The last ordinal downloaded to the Node.
                - The latest ordinal found on the block explorer.
    - {colored('sessions','cyan')}: Comparison of the Node v. Cluster session.
    - {colored('on network','cyan')}: True or False if the Node is on the correct cluster.
    - {colored('up time','cyan')}: Amount of time the Node, VPS, and Cluster has been consecutively
               up and running.
    - {colored('nodeid','cyan')}: shortened abbreviation of the Node's public key.
    - {colored('in consensus','cyan')}: True, False or Preparing. If in {colored('preparing','cyan')}, the Node may 
                    be in a stage that is not ready for consensus but is properly moving towards a 
                    stage that allow it to join consensus when reached.
                  
  {colored('Note','yellow')}: When the Node starts up or restarts, it will review the latest ordinal,
        download that ordinal and then work its way backward to the last known ordinal
        it ever knew about.  This can cause the {colored('last dled','cyan')} to show
        as a lower ordinal than the latest on the Node.
    
  {colored('States','yellow')}: Initial,Offline,ReadyToJoin,StartingSession,SessionStarted,
          ReadyToDownload,WaitingForDownload,DownloadInProgress,
          Observing,WaitingForReady,Ready,Leaving,Offline,ApiNotReady
  
  {colored('Quick Status','green')}:
  This command will show an abbreviated version of the status command that
  reviews the status of your Node based on the local API on the Node.
  Local API calls can produce false information if the Node is
  forked.  This produces a quick response because it does not

  To help secure your Node down a little further it is recommended 
  to change the {colored("well known port number","yellow")} for SSH
  [ secure shell protocol ] from port {colored("22","cyan")} to a more
  indiscriminate port between [1024 and 65535].
  
  This command will execute the SSH port change on your Node by updating
  the ssh configuration and restarting the SSH daemon.

  required:
  {colored('--port <new_port_number>','green')}
  
  Port number must be between {colored("1024","cyan")} and {colored("65535","cyan")}
  
  Port number should not conflict with the {colored("public","cyan")}, {colored("p2p","cyan")}, and {colored("cli","cyan")} port numbers
  configured in the configuration file for all profiles.
  
  {colored("NOTE:","yellow",attrs=['bold'])} This is just a preventative measure and does not 
  ensure your Node will be fully protected from nefarious actors.  
  However, every step helps.

  This command can be used to manually update the Node's version
  object.  This functionality is completed automatically by the 
  nodectl's versioning service every 5 minutes.
  
  To ensure that you have the latest version details you can 
  utilize this command to update the object immediately.
  
  When executed, if the versioning object is deemed not in need
  of an update, it will not update the object unless the {colored("-f","cyan")}
  option is used to force an update.

  optional:
  {colored('-f','green')} force
  {colored('-v','green')} verify
  {colored('--print','green')} print the contents of the object
    
  The {colored("-v","cyan")} optional option can be used to verify that the
  contents of the versioning object is valid and contains the proper key
  pair values.
    
  The {colored("--print","cyan")} optional option can be used to print out
  the contents of the versioning object.
    
  Example Usage
  -------------
